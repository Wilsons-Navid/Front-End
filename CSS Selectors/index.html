        <p>Pseudo-classes offer us different ways to target 
        elements in our HTML. There are quite a lot of them, 
        and they come in a couple of different flavors. 
        Programming refers to a technological process for 
        telling a computer which tasks to perform in order 
        to solve problems . You can think of programming as 
        a collaboration between humans and computers, 
        in which humans create instructions for a computer 
        to follow (code) 
        in a language computers can understand.
    </p>

       <p>Some are based on their position or structure within 
        the HTML. Others are based on the state of a particular 
        element, or how the user is currently interacting with</p>

        <p>it. There are too many to cover in detail here but weâ€™ll
         have a look at some of the most useful ones.</p>

        <p>Pseudo-classes share the same specificity as 
         regular classes (0, 0, 1, 0). 
        Just like regular classes, most can be chained together</P>
