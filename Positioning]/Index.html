    <h1>Types of positioning - Scroll to notice the effects</h1>
    
<div class="fix">Fixed Positioning</div>
<div class="Relative"> <span>Relative Positioning</span> When you set the position relative to an element, 
    without adding any other positioning attributes (top, bottom, right, left) nothing will happen. 
    When you add an additional position apart from relative, such as left: 20px the element will move 
    20px to the right from its normal position. Here, you can see that this element is relative to itself.
    When the element moves, no other element on the layout will be affected.

    There is a thing you should keep in mind while setting position 
    - relative to an element limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. 
    This means that any element that is the child of this element can be absolutely positioned within this block.
    
    After this brief explanation, we need to back it up, by showing an example.
    
    In this example, you will see how the relative positioned element moves when its attributes are changed. 
    The first element moves to the left and top from its normal position, while the second element stays in 
    the same place because none of the additional positioning attributes were changed.</div>

<div class="Absolute"><span>Absolute Positioning:</span> Absolute positioning allows you to place your element precisely where you want it.

    Absolute positioning is done relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element. 
    In the case when there is no positioned parent element, the element that has position set to absolute will 
    be positioned related directly to the HTML element (the page itself).
    
    An important thing to keep in mind while using absolute positioning is to make sure it is not overused, 
    otherwise, it can lead to a maintenance nightmare.
    
    The next thing, yet again, is to show an example of absolute positioning.
    
  
  In the example, the parent element has the position set to relative. Now, when you set the position of the child element 
  to absolute, any additional positioning will be done relative to the parent element. The child element moves relatively to
   the top of the parent element by 100px and right of the parent element by 40px. </div>
   <div class="container">
<div class="Sticky"><span>Sticky Positioning:</span> I assume you all know CSS Positions, but les have a brief review:

    Up until 3 years ago, there were four CSS Positions: static, relative, absolute and fixed.
    
    The main difference between static or relative and absolute or fixed was the 
    space they take up in the flow of the DOM. Positions static & relative keep their natural 
    space in the flow of the document, while the absolute & fixed â€” 
    their space is removed and they have a floating behavior.
    
    The new Position Sticky has similarities with all types, as I will soon explain.
    
    My First Play with Position Sticky
    I assume most of you have played with position sticky. So had I for quite a while, 
    until I realized that I  totally understand it.
    
    On the first play with position sticky, everyone quickly understands that the element 
    sticks when the viewport gets to the defined position.
    
    Example:
    
    .some-component{
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
    } 
    The problem is that sometimes it works while other times it When it does work, 
    the element sticks, but in other parts of the scrolling it stops sticking. As someone who 
    eats and breaths CSS daily, it was unacceptable for me to not understand the issue to its root , 
    so I decided to thoroughly explore Position Sticky.
    
    The Sticky Exploration
    While playing with it, I quickly noticed that when an element with a position: sticky style is wrapped, 
    and it is the only element inside the wrapper element, this element, which was defined position: sticky will not stick.</div>
